packman todo list
================================================================================
[ ] definitely need something to have single (non packaged) files also going through the merger and ending up in destination, without having to specify them as packages one by one in the config. In fact, could do this with a simple flag at config root level, something like "treatRemainingFilesAsStandalonePackages" (shorter of course). So that, at the end of the resolution, we just look for non included files, and put them as packages of their own, using the global visitors
[ ] implement the conditional visitor
[ ] implement the special AT visitors ....  
[ ] instead of crappy md5, do the first few chars of the sha1, and give an example doc or visitor) that creates the piece of HTML that includes the files an include.html for instance that has the <link href=...sha1.css> and <script src=...sha1.js> or maybe just a piece of txt that has the map or something)  
[ ] make it easy from visitors API) to open/close and write to files, given the destination root folder  
[ ] implement a simple versioning visitor on a version tag given in cfg, put all destination files in a new /tag/ directory to avoid having to repeat this tag throughout the cfg)  
[ ] make it easier to pass configuration to visitors, even from extra custom command line args, so that for instance it's easy to run packman twice with the conditional visitor: packman -Dbrowser=IE7 and packman -Dbrowser=FF below)  
[ ] Put in place custom visitors args from the command line: something like -Dkey1=value1 -Dkey2=value2 etc...  
[ ] Do the same from the config itself, dedicated place in the config to store custom args, and the custom args from the command line will come in the same object too if conceptually, the whole config object is open)  
[ ] split further the files in lib utils, yaml, ...) for easier testing 

[x] would be good if visitors could also have a onBeforeResolve or something, to be able to treat the packages config even before its looked at by packman
[x] stats visitor, runs onEnd, outputs a txt file containing stats about the packaged files, how many pakaged files, their size and gzipped), how many files are inside each package ...
